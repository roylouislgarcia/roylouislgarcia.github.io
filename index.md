**WELCOME TO MY BLOG**

<img  class="image-left" src="/assets/images/recent.jpg">Life provides many lessons and opportunities that help us progress and add value to our journey. I try to record these blissful moments in writing. My writings may not offer some grand illumination, but what I am hoping to accomplish is to offer some alternative view on certain subjects that we both may find interesting. I would be thankful if you find reading some of my posts rewarding and would be happy to learn from you, as well. Feel free to comment on my posts, send me a direct message via twitter [@roylouisgarcia](https://twitter.com/roylouisgarcia) or send me an email (see my contact info below). Thank you.
