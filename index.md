**WELCOME TO MY BLOG**

<img  class="image-left" src="/assets/images/recent.jpg">Life provides many lessons and opportunities that help us progress and add value to our journey. I try to record these blissful moments in writing. My writings may not offer some grand illumination, but what I am hoping to accomplish is offer some alternative perspective on certain subjects that I find interesting. I would be thankful if you find value on my efforts to share. Feel free to email me or comment on my blog if any of my posts interest you.
