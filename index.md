**WELCOME TO MY BLOG**

These blog is a consolidation of some writings using various pseudonyms all throughout my career. These pseudonyms were used to compartmentalize the growing list of concerns I encountered as a learner, professional, and a person. 

The point of this blog is to "try" to be comprehensive, informal, personal, and even funny(?). In this blog, the pseudonyms dissipate.
