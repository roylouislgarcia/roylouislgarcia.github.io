**NostradmsX** is the pseudonym I started using back in the AOL and Yahoo days. I even used it as the business name for my first web development and design contract. 

I have varying genesis stories of my pseudonym and one of them is the idea of "altruism". I used to use **"no_str_a"** (__no strings attached__) as a signature for probono projects that I got involved in when I was learning to be a web developer. I later dropped the underscores and preferred being called **"nostra"**. 

Another genesis story relates to my passion for reading fictional and non-fictional books about the Italian organized crime known as La Cosa **Nostra**, or the Mafia. I wrote essays on the Corleones, the Gambinos and even the Sopranos. Come to think of it, I should have kept an electronic copies of those essays and posted them in this blogs. 

Last but not the least is my affinity to what lies ahead. The french seer Michel de Nostredame "Nostradamus" and his works riddled my early years. My attitude to look beyond the ordinary may have started when I tried to decipher some of his works instead of working on algebra problems. Eventually, I respected the idea of letting the future reveal itself, but not without any attempt to balance the use of my analytical brain and gut feeling. **NostradmsX** often wears the hat of a futurist, or at least try to mimic one.
