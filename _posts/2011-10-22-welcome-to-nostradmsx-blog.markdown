**NostradmsX** is the pseudonym I started using back in the AOL and Yahoo days. I even used it as the business name for my first web development and design contract. 

I have varying genesis stories of my pseudonym and one of them is the idea of "altruism". I used to use **"no_str_a"** (__no strings attached__) as a signature for probono projects that I got involved in when I was learning to be a web developer. I later dropped the underscores and preferred being called **"nostra"**. 

Another genesis story relates to my passion for reading fictional and non-fictional books about the Italian organized crime known as La Cosa **Nostra**, or the Mafia. I wrote essays on the Corleones, the Gambinos and even the Sopranos. Come to think of it, I should have kept an electronic copies of those essays and posted them in this blogs. 

Last but not the least is my affinity to the works and character of the french seer Michel de Nostredame "Nostradamus". It is not about pure mysticism, the divine, or astrological arramgement of stars, but acting on gut feeling. I adapted a lifestyle of habits and routines, but I made sure to do some things unexpected to break out of the monotonous, cyclic aspect of life. Being too calculated and too careful make you miss out on opportunities.

My attitude to look beyond the ordinary may have started when I tried to research on some of **Nostra**damus's works. Eventually, I succumb to letting the future reveal itself. When it comes to technology, **NostradmsX** often wears the hat of a futurist. With enough reverence to the work of others and the sensitivity to the needs I see around me, I try to anticipate and do something to make technological artifacts that assist others.
