I often find myself doubtful whether I had done enough to gain merit for tasks that I had sought out to complete. Even when the deadline is approaching, I tend to make finishing touches and a continually _second guess_ myself.

In college, a friend told me to relax a bit and be ok with submitting mediocre deliverables every now and then. "We do not need to cover everything, and when we present it, we need to act like we are the experts of whatever we are reporting about." I often felt uneasy pretending. I find a way to let my audience know that I may not be a subject matter on the subject, but I can refer them to the works of experts in the field. This was the beginning of gradually building my habit of citing resources, building upon other people's thoughts, and being risking formulating and expressing original thoughts. 

There are times the _pretending_ may be warranted. I remember how my father would rather visit every streets than stop driving to ask people in the streets for direction. He believed that pretending to be one of the city folks may prevent street gangs from victimizing us. On one occassion, my father convinced a traffic officer that he went against a one-way street because we were lost and it was an honest mistake. Oh, no.. my father was not pretending to be lost. We were, but I was the one pretending not to know him, at all. It was embarrassing to see all the cars parked facing the opposite direction and a _oneway_ sign was only a few feet away.  

I wish it would be this easy to fake my way into being a _developer_, just as the cliche says to "fake it until you make it." What is easy is to admit that you need to know how to formulate the right questions, do due-diligence to try and tinker with the code, search if the same issue has been answered already, and other habits that can help you become a proficient _developer_, even if you do not climb up any _rank ladder board_ of _developers_.

**Learning** is not an overnight process. It is a **journey** that can take a lot from someone. _The more you learn, the more you become aware of things you do not know._ However, learners should give themselves credit for starting their journey, may it be a journey to learn new things or relearn what they already know. Knowledge is ever-growing, anyways.  

Just like some artists who are often critical of their own work, it is ok to refactor code for improvement, or even doubt your own work. Get others to critic your work. If the syndrome insists on putting you down, collaborate with others and get peer review. You may be just hard on yourself, too. Just like me, you may need to avoid second-guessing yourself and admit that maybe, even experts consider themselves unworthy to admit that their journey in learning what they claim to be expert of is not always over. We are perpetual learners in life.

**Journey in Learning**

In college, we used learning content management systems, such as Moodle and Blackboard.com to complement the courses we took in school. These systems were an emerging paradigm that provided alternatives to the _'sage on stage'_ teaching methodology that most brick-and-mortar students were accustomed to. Aside from the syllabus, most documents related to future lessons were made available so some students can prepare in advance and learn more.

Around 2012, articles like this one written by Laura Pappano were sporadically announcing the growth of MOOCs or Massive Open Online Courses: [online link to the article](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/04/education/edlife/massive-open-online-courses-are-multiplying-at-a-rapid-pace.html) or [offline pdf](/assets/images/resources/moocs.pdf)

As a learner, I created blogs to chronicle my journey in learning from various MOOC sites. I am planning to post some updated version of the tutorials I hosted on these blogs here.
