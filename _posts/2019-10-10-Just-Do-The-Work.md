It took me a long time to start writing again. Why did I stop, some of you may ask? It is not because I had nothing to say. Believe me, I have more to say about the progressing world; like on how I try to catch up. I have lots to say about how I break down my dreams into smaller dreams and how I create habits and microhabits to remain relevant. 

My silence does not even mean that I succumb to deny my discontent. I have lots to say.
