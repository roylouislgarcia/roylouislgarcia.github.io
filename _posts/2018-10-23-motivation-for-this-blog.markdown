As a freelancer, I constantly try to reinvent my branding strategies. As I acquire more knowledge from taking some MOOC (Massive Open Online Courses) in order to remain relevant in the IT industry, I try to compartmentalize the growing list of products and services I offer. 

Also, I try to disassociate my professional work from my personal projects. Doing paid and probono projects in order to utilize what I learned not only provides an opportunity to __show__ people what I know, but also __help__ others while __helping myself__ get enough real life experience. Developing products and actually rolling them out in production is as important as catching up on what is trending or the hottest new programming language to learn. 

I created pseudonyms, such as **NostradmsX**, **Radyouloroy**, **Andyroid**, and others in order to compartmentalize the various IT disciplines I dabble into. 

Since the point of this blog is to be comprehensive on all my works, I try to be more informal than the blogs I used to maintain professionally.
