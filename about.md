**History of my Pseudonyms**:

As an entrepreneur, I constantly reinvent my branding strategies to remain fresh and relevant. **NostradmsX Designs** and **Redbox Designs** were offered products and services related to web development. **DMSX Solutions** and **Journey in Learning** helped with social media marketing, SEO (Search Engine Optimization), branding, datascraping, sentiment analysis, and social media administration. Lastly, **Journey in Learning** and **Privasecurity** pushed to advance issues relating to _inclusive learning_, _assistive technology_, _privacy_, _computer security_ and others. 

Also, as a _perpetual learner and technology tinker_, I enrolled in some MOOC (Massive Open Online Courses) in order to remain relevant in the IT industry. I created course reviews and tutorials to help other learners like me.

I try to disassociate my professional work from my personal projects. Doing paid and *Pro Bono* projects in order to utilize what I learned not only provides an opportunity to __show__ people what I know, but also __help__ others while __helping myself__ build on practical experience and test out concepts. Developing products and actually rolling them out in production is as important as catching up on what is trending or the hottest new programming language to learn. 

Security, anonymity, and privacy needs prompted me to create other pseudonyms, such as **Radyouloroy**, **Andyroid**, and others in order to compartmentalize the various IT disciplines I dabble into without compromising my private life.

**Tools Used to Create These Blog**

This blog is written in Jekyll and is using the default Minima theme. I have overridden the main.css file to make a dark theme version of Minima.
