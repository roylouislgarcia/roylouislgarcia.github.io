**MOTIVATION FOR THIS BLOG**


This blog may serve as a link between the various works I created in various pseudonyms. As a freelancer, I constantly try to reinvent my branding strategies. For example, **NostradmsX Designs**, **Redbox Designs**, and **DMSX Solutions** were all related to web development. **Journey in Learning** was a social media marketing that helped company with search engine optimization, branding, datascraping, sentiment analysis, and social media administration. The pseudonyms were used to ompartmentalize the growing list of products and services I offer as a professional.

Also, as a _perpetual learner and technology tinker_, I enrolled in some MOOC (Massive Open Online Courses) in order to remain relevant in the IT industry. I created course reviews and tutorials to help other learners like me.

I try to disassociate my professional work from my personal projects. Doing paid and probono projects in order to utilize what I learned not only provides an opportunity to __show__ people what I know, but also __help__ others while __helping myself__ get enough real life experience. Developing products and actually rolling them out in production is as important as catching up on what is trending or the hottest new programming language to learn. 

Security, anonymity, and privacy needs prompted me to create other pseudonyms, such as **Radyouloroy**, **Andyroid**, **JourneyLearner** and others in order to compartmentalize the various IT disciplines I dabble into without compromising my private life. 

The point of this blog is to "try" to be comprehensive, informal, personal, and even funny(?). This is were all my pseudonyms dissipate.


_Tools:_

This blog is written in Jekyll and is using the default Minima theme. I have overridden the main.css file to make a dark theme version of Minima.

You can find out more info about customizing your Jekyll theme, as well as basic Jekyll usage documentation at [jekyllrb.com](https://jekyllrb.com/)
