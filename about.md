This blog contains some of my raw thoughts and projects relating to things I am passionate about. Some posts are about personal projects, tech news, movies, software, products, etc.. I may even include some tutorials on my recent tinkerings which may expose how some of my ideas hold against practical application. 

Some of the blog posts I will include can be characterized as either a thought exercise or actually building tangible projects that represent some of the concepts that I want to think and tinker with.

If you wish to find out more about me, please visit my online portfolio at [www.nostradmsx.com](www.nostradmsx.com).
