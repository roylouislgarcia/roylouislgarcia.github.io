**MOTIVATION FOR THIS BLOG**

This blog may serve as a link between the various works I created using various pseudonyms. The pseudonyms were used to compartmentalize the growing list of products and services I offer as a professional.

As a freelancer, I constantly try to reinvent my branding strategies. For example, **NostradmsX Designs** and **Redbox Designs** were related to web development. **DMSX Solutions** and **Journey in Learning** helped with social media marketing, SEO (Search Engine Optimization), branding, datascraping, sentiment analysis, and social media administration. Lastly, **Journey in Learning** and **Privasecurity** pushed to advance issues relating to _inclusive learning_, _assistive technology_, _privacy_, _computer security_ and others. 

Also, as a _perpetual learner and technology tinker_, I enrolled in some MOOC (Massive Open Online Courses) in order to remain relevant in the IT industry. I created course reviews and tutorials to help other learners like me.

I try to disassociate my professional work from my personal projects. Doing paid and probono projects in order to utilize what I learned not only provides an opportunity to __show__ people what I know, but also __help__ others while __helping myself__ get enough real life experience. Developing products and actually rolling them out in production is as important as catching up on what is trending or the hottest new programming language to learn. 

Security, anonymity, and privacy needs prompted me to create other pseudonyms, such as **Radyouloroy**, **Andyroid**, and others in order to compartmentalize the various IT disciplines I dabble into without compromising my private life. 

The point of this blog is to "try" to be comprehensive, informal, personal, and even funny(?). In this blog, the pseudonyms dissipate.


_Tools:_

This blog is written in Jekyll and is using the default Minima theme. I have overridden the main.css file to make a dark theme version of Minima.

You can find out more info about customizing your Jekyll theme, as well as basic Jekyll usage documentation at [jekyllrb.com](https://jekyllrb.com/)

You can find the source code for Minima at GitHub:
