Technology is a tool that can provide value to people's lives. In order to achieve that, someone like an *administrator* should advocate for optimized, secured and safe utilization of technology. It can be done by example, policies, configurations, and user education. 

I love trying to *empower* the people that I love to not be afraid of technology. I often encourage my mother to expand her comfort zone on technology and not to assume that she might break the computer if she makes some mistake using it. However, there are really products out there that are complicated to use. Some "design architecture" or "nudge" need to help users. An *administrator* has the power and responsibility to try to hide the complexities of systems and let users focus on what they want to achieve using technology.
