Nowadays, we do not need to do as much in order to add on to the growing number of data that companies mine. The moment we turn on our computer or cell phone, we add on to the data we knowingly (or unknowlingly - depends if we read the fine prints of most of the Terms of Services and Privacy Policies) submit to big companies. We submit cookies, user data, personal information, and other information. Data Science make sense of these data to create insights that can be either benefit or harm us. I explore these issues in order to stay aware and informed.
