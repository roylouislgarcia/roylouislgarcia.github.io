 Here are some tools, issues, skills, and other computer security-related recommendations. *Warning: I am not advocating the use of tools, knowledge, and exploits on machines that do not belong to you. Please do not break the law.* Penetration Testings should be done against your own instances of virtual machines and network. Create a sandbox or detached laboratory in order to have a safe environment for learning and practice.
