The idea of programming predates the computer. A wind up music box can be thought of *programming* or positioning pins on a rotating drum that pluck the teeth of a comb that eventually creates sounds of various pitch (see a video that explains [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COty6_oDEkk)). I constantly learn programming languages and evolving programming paradigms. I try to write about them, too.
