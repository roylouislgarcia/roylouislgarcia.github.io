# This is my new Jekyll blog site

_Tools:_

This blog is written in Jekyll and is using the default Minima theme. I have overridden the main.css file to make a dark theme version of Minima.

You can find out more info about customizing your Jekyll theme, as well as basic Jekyll usage documentation at [jekyllrb.com](https://jekyllrb.com/)

You can find the source code for Minima at GitHub:
